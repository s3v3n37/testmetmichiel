In fact, this book sets out to answer five essentialons: What are the key factors that influence your ability to create the results you desire, and how can you develop those factors? What are the obstacles that may have been holding you or your organization back from getting the results you want, and how can you avoid, eliminate or overcome those obstacles? How can you increase your impact on other people, engaging them in your enterprises and/ or empowering them to create the results they desire? How can you leverage your true nature as a results-creator and a leader to get greater control of your livelihood, whether as a solopreneur, as an entrepreneur or by playing a bigger role in your organization? How can you do all of this in a way that's healthy, natural, authentic and enjoyable?
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
There's a shortest possible time required for you to create a result, but nobody knows how long that shortest possible time is. The only way to discover it is experimentally, by taking action.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Your results may be closer than you think. Of course, we live in a material world, and there are certain universal laws or ‘principles’ that cannot be violated (e.g. the principle of gravity). But all too often it is not material laws, but rather our beliefs, concepts and misunderstandings which place artificial limits on the results we produce, on the impact we have and on our enjoyment of life in general.

GROUNDING Your Personal Transformation
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Subtractive psychology: Less is more While this book is divided into three sections for practical purposes, they actually describe three different aspects of one transformation: the process of becoming the person who can create the results you're here to create, and more fully live the life you're here to live. Most approaches for creating results are additive, giving you theories, techniques and concepts to remember, practise and apply. While additive approaches are often compelling, they rarely yield the desired results (for reasons we'll explore later). Fortunately, the understanding you're going to be developing as you read this book is subtractive. Instead of giving you more to remember, the principles you're going to be learning will take things off your mind, giving you less to think about. As a result, you're going to have a clear mind, more of the time, and more space for the endeavours and experiences that matter.

You're Built for Reality; You're Optimized for Results
</div>

<div class="noteText">
You're built for reality. You're optimized for results. You've evolved to survive, transform and thrive.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
You're going to be introduced to the ‘operating system’ of your innate capacities and instincts for creating meaningful results and living a life you love. As you discover the results-creator that's been right there within you your whole life, your ability to create the results you desire and enjoy the process is going to increase exponentially.
</div>

You're built for reality, optimized for success, with the factory-settings for creating results.

There's a built-in quality check that nature has performed on every one of your ancestors going back millions of years: were they fit enough, resilient enough, attractive enough, creative enough, aware enough, courageous enough and wise enough to get safely to breeding age, have children and pass on their genetic material? The fact that you're here means the answer to that question was ‘yes’, hundreds of thousands of times in succession. You are a state-of-the-art results-creator, tempered in the furnace of millions of years of evolution.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
And one of the most valuable gifts that helps you survive and thrive in reality is your innate capacity for realization and insight.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
A realization is a fresh new thought; an insight that brings your understanding more closely into alignment with the truth of some aspect of life.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
realization revealed the existence of pre-existing facts about some aspect of life; principles or laws behind how life already works.

As you started exploring this new domain, you effortlessly processed the megabytes of data pouring through your senses and had realizations about the fact of gravity. These realizations came automatically,

<div class="noteText">
You have an innate capacity for realization.
</div>

<div class="noteText">
A realization brings you more closely into alignment with reality. The more aligned with reality you are, the more effective you can be at creating results.

These two images have always been part of the ‘reality’ of the logo. You may have looked at them hundreds or even thousands of times. You may not have noticed them until now, but they've always been there. The mechanism that takes you from ‘looking’ to ‘seeing’ is realization; a hit of fresh new perception that arrives from beyond your existing model of reality. And once you've seen them, you'll never be able to un-see them.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
You possess superpowers
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Your innate capacity for realization is one of a number of ‘superpowers’ you possess; the deep drivers you benefited from as you learned to walk. Take a moment to imagine you're looking out at the world through the eyes of a toddler… Your innate capacity for direction shows you a purpose and possibility that inspire and motivate you. Your innate capacity for resilience enables you to take risks, recover and get back up every time you fall over. Your innate capacity for creativity has you innovating different approaches and creating solutions to problems. Your innate capacity for authenticity means you trust yourself and stay true to your authentic desires. Your innate capacity for intuition lets you know when to practise, when to rest and when to try something different. Your innate capacity for presence keeps you close to reality; aware, insightful and learning rapidly. Your innate capacity for connection allows you to be playful and loving, secure in yourself and your world. Your innate capacity for clarity lets you play full-out, clear-minded and at the very edge of your abilities.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
So if we all have these innate capacities and instincts, what gets in the way?
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The single biggest barrier to progress– and the cause of most frustration, stuckness and suffering– is an innocent and widespread misunderstanding about how our minds work.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Your experience is being generated from within you, right now! The human mind has an extraordinary job to do. Millions of bits of information arrive at our senses every second. Our minds process that data, combine it with information from our memory banks and weave a coherent and stable perceptual reality that we experience as ‘real’. The mind-made perceptual reality we construct seems so real to us that we rarely question its validity…
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Your experience of everything you can see, hear, feel, taste and smell is being generated from within you, moment to moment. Even the things you can see and hear ‘out there’ are experiences being generated from within you (albeit, with a live data-feed). It seems to us as though we look out through our eyes at a world ‘out there’, but our perception is less like looking through the lens of a camera and more like a projector or a set of virtual reality goggles. Please note: I'm not saying that everything ‘out there’ is being generated from within you; I'm saying that your experience of everything ‘out there’ is being generated from within you, using the power of THOUGHT: the reality principle.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
THOUGHT: the reality principle People think. The principle of THOUGHT refers to our innate capacity to generate a perceptual reality; an outer and inner world that we can see, hear, feel, taste and smell. This principle is also the source of the countless thoughts and perceptions that arise in the course of a day.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The sentence ‘You’re living in the feeling of the principle of THOUGHT taking form in the moment' can be stated in a variety of ways… You're living in the experience of THOUGHT in the moment. You're living in a THOUGHT-generated perceptual reality. You're living in your moment-to-moment state of mind/ attitude/ mindset/ mood.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Your whole experience of life is a THOUGHT-generated totality; an undivided unity springing into being, moment by moment. There is no division between thinking and feeling, psychology and emotion. It is one unified experience being created using the power of THOUGHT.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
This simple formula, Clarity equals Capacity minus Contamination, points us back to the innate capacities and deep drivers we talked about in Chapter 1… Capacity: You have an innate capacity for wellbeing, realization, resilience and high performance. You're built for reality and optimized for results. Contamination: The only thing that ever obscures this capacity is contaminated thinking, arising from the outside-in misunderstanding. Clarity: As you wake up from that misunderstanding and get more closely aligned with reality, clarity emerges. As you experience greater clarity in your life, you're going to have realizations and insights into what results matter to you and for you. You'll also have greater access to your innate capacities for bringing those results into being while enjoying the process.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
A clear mind is essential for high performance,
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
your mood is like a pair of glasses; your feelings are telling you about the glasses you're wearing, not what you're looking at. Seeing through the outside-in misunderstanding is the quickest, most effective way to enjoy a clear mind, more of the time, with high levels of connection, motivation and performance.

Eliminating Worry, Anxiety and Fear of Criticism
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Worry, anxiety and fear of criticism are ‘optical illusions of the mind’, with no more reality than a daydream or a highway mirage.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
So what do I mean by ‘optical illusions of the mind’?
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The teddy bear factor Let's take a universal example: the teddy bear. Small children are often given a stuffed toy or security blanket that they take to bed at night. If the child ‘bonds’ with the teddy bear, then (before long) it seems to the child like the bear is a source of peace, comfort and security. But this is a trick of the mind– 100% of the feelings of peace, security and comfort are generated from within the child. It seems like they're coming from the teddy bear, but the bear is neutral. If the teddy gets lost, or left behind when the family goes on holiday, it seems to the child like the absence of the bear is the source of their feelings of worry, anxiety and insecurity. But this too is a trick of the mind. The feelings may seem like they're coming from the lack of the teddy bear, but 100% of them are coming from within the child. This example is uncontroversial, but how quickly do we change our tune when we substitute the ‘adult teddy bears’ of money, jobs or romantic partners? Of our future hopes, fears or uncertainties? Of our past victories, defeats or indiscretions? How different does it seem when we ponder the ‘teddy bear’ of our physical body, our health or our personality? 100% of your feelings of worry, anxiety and insecurity are generated from within you, even when it seems like they're coming from an ‘adult teddy bear’. The same goes for your feelings of peace, security and comfort. The teddy bear is always neutral. It appears as though the sun rises, but it's an illusion caused by the rotation of the earth. It seems like our feelings of security come from our income, our relationships or our teddy bears, but it's an illusion caused by our conditioning and perception. Of course, this doesn't just apply to our feelings of security; it also holds true for feelings of insecurity.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The illusion that tricks us into believing our felt experience is being generated from something other than THOUGHT is both compelling and invisible. We all get fooled by it, and we will continue to get fooled by it from time to time. There's no immunity from this trick of the mind. There is, however, an inoculation… As you continue to deepen your understanding of the principles behind clarity, you'll be tricked less often and wake up more quickly when you do get tricked.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Why feelings of worry or anxiety are not the problem Everyone sometimes experiences feelings of insecurity, such as worry, anxiety or self-doubt. That's not a problem. Those feelings are giving you feedback on the totality of your THOUGHT-generated experience in the moment, and that's really useful. The problem is that you sometimes believe your feelings are letting you know about something other than THOUGHT. And why is that a problem? Here's a simple analogy: Cars have a fuel gauge and a speedometer. These are feedback mechanisms, each designed to measure one thing. The fuel gauge gives feedback on the amount of fuel in the car's fuel tank. The speedometer gives feedback on the speed the wheels are turning at. The fuel gauge is an expert on the fuel level and nothing else. The speedometer is an expert on the speed and nothing else. The fuel gauge doesn't know anything about the speed, and the speedometer doesn't know anything about the fuel level.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Each gauge is a mechanism that gives feedback on one thing. If you mistakenly believed that the speedometer was giving you feedback on the fuel level, you would soon be in trouble.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Why feelings are nothing personal Your feelings are an incredibly precise and accurate gauge or signal. They've evolved over hundreds of thousands of years, to help you live, thrive and survive here on earth (remember, you're built for reality). Your body has countless feedback loops and signalling systems to govern things as diverse as body temperature, hydration and pH level. Just as your car's gauges give you precise feedback about fuel level and speed respectively, your internal ‘gauges’ each give you feedback on one thing: Your feelings are a feedback mechanism, designed to measure one thing. Your feelings give you feedback on the principle of THOUGHT taking form in the moment. Your feelings are a reflection of THOUGHT in the moment and nothing else. Feelings are impersonal. Our feelings don't know anything about our past, our future, our circumstances, other people or what we're like. Our feelings are a mechanism that give feedback on one thing: the totality of our THOUGHT-generated perceptual reality in this moment. When we mistakenly believe our feelings are letting us know about something other than that, we've slipped into La-la Land.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
When you're ‘hanging out in reality’, you do very well. You get intuitions about what to do, about when to rest and when to take action. Your innate capacities are fully available to you when you're hanging out in reality, living in the present moment. You have a natural capacity to connect with other people. You have a natural capacity for insight and realization. You have a natural capacity to take action on things that matter to you. All of that and more is available to you when you're hanging out in reality. But it's a little harder to come by when you're hanging out in La-la Land. The moment a person believes that they're feeling something other than THOUGHT in the moment, they've stepped into an illusory non-reality; a world that doesn't exist.

As Mahima's fear evaporated, she found that she was more engaged with life, not less. She was more capable and resourceful; able to give her all to the situation, secure in the knowledge that she'd be able to handle it, whatever happened.

<div class="noteText">
You can think of this sense of ‘I am’ like a light that illuminates whatever we shine it on. When a person says ‘I am Alex’, ‘I am stuck’ or ‘I am confident’, it's similar to an equal sign, creating an equation in our perception that goes something like this: Once we've shone that sense of ‘I am’ on one of these concepts, it can really feel as though that's who or what we really are. But who you really are isn't your name, an emotion or some other label. Who you really are is that sense of ‘I am’. You are not what you think; you are the thinker. You are not what the light is shining on; you are the light. We're going to be referring to the light of ‘I am’ as CONSCIOUSNESS: the experience principle.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
CONSCIOUSNESS: the experience principle People are aware. The principle of CONSCIOUSNESS refers to our capacity to have an experience of THOUGHT taking form in the moment. CONSCIOUSNESS brings our THOUGHT-generated experiential reality to life.

<div class="noteText">
When you were a little child, you likely spent much of your time in a peaceful, contented state of mind. While you probably had many things that temporarily bothered you, you always returned to that place of peace and connection with your inner self; your wellbeing.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Then somewhere along the way, we were trained to believe that admission to that place of peace and connection was conditional; that it had to be earned, bought or achieved. And that it could be withheld for bad behaviour. We were conditioned to look outside ourselves for the peace, happiness and security that can only be found within.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The moment you realize that you already have what you've been searching for until now, you step into a different world. You'll still have results you're inspired to create, and you may use goals, targets or other objectives to achieve them, but where you're ‘coming from’ – the feeling you're living in– is entirely different…
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
You

<br>
<div class="noteText">
You are psychologically safe Here's why there's nothing that can harm you psychologically: You're always living in the feeling of THOUGHT in the moment and always have been, even if you hadn't realized it until now. For the rest of your life, you're never going to feel anything other than THOUGHT in the moment. Ever. No matter what. And there's no thinking that can harm you. This is beautiful because it means you have the ultimate protection built into your psychological and emotional system. It means you're psychologically safe from harm or attack.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Don't get me wrong; it's certainly possible for a person to believe they're a victim of circumstance. The illusory power of THOUGHT is so convincing and compelling that we all get fooled by it from time to time. The power of THOUGHT gives people the ability to believe all kinds of things, but that doesn't make them true. It's possible for people to believe the earth is flat, but that doesn't mean it actually is flat. Similarly, it's possible for us to believe we're victims of circumstance, but you can't actually be a victim of circumstance.

One of the qualities they identified that all the exponential organizations share is a ‘massive transformational purpose’ (MTP). You may be familiar with some of these, for instance… TED's MTP is to spread ideas. Uber's MTP is to evolve the way the world moves. Kickstarter's MTP is to help bring creative projects to life. Duolingo's MTP is to give everyone access to education of the highest quality– for free. LinkedIn's MTP is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. Google's MTP is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
a sense of purpose and direction are innate; as natural to you as breathing. When you were a child, a purpose would find you, captivate you and guide you until you transcended it. This is the sense of evolutionary purpose that has already motivated you… To crawl, to walk and to talk. To explore the world and learn about what fascinates you. To throw yourself into pastimes, hobbies and other activities. To develop skills and master them. A purpose finds you, captivates you, then guides you until you transcend it.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Are you open to the possibility that your innate capacity for purpose and direction is guiding you in this very moment?
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The misguided search for purpose is the biggest obstacle to finding it.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
You can't find something where it isn't Consider these phrases: ‘I’m stuck. I've lost my sense of purpose'. ‘I’m looking for my purpose'. ‘I’m trying to find a sense of direction in my life'. They imply that ‘purpose’ is something external; something you can find, have, lose or lack.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
But your purpose is not a material object. It's a fresh new thought that arrives as an insight; a realization that brings you closer to the reality of life that you're part of.

Imagine a whirlpool or eddy in a fast-flowing river. While you could name the whirlpool and describe its characteristics, it has no existence independent of the river. While you can perceive the whirlpool as distinct and separate for practical purposes, it is never actually separate. The whirlpool is inseparable from the river, part of an undivided whole.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
While you have a name and can describe your characteristics, you have no existence independent of the oneness of life. While you can perceive yourself as distinct and separate for practical purposes, you are never actually separate. You are inseparable from the intelligence and oneness of life, part of an undivided whole.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
We'll be referring to the oneness of life as the principle of MIND. You, your life and your purpose in the moment are all an expression of this formless principle.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
MIND: the power principle People are alive. The principle of MIND is the ‘intelligent energy’ that shows up in all aspects of the natural world. MIND is the ‘power source’ behind life. Various cultures and fields have different names for this power: Life force, universal energy, chi, nature, the great spirit, God, the no-thing, evolution, random chance etc. You can think of it in whatever way makes sense to you.

Purpose is a thought, and like all thoughts, it comes with a feeling.

Your evolutionary purpose is less likely to be something you ‘figure out’ so much as something you glimpse or realize; a function of your innate capacity for insight. When you have such a realization, it may have some of these qualities… It may come with a feeling of gentle certainty or knowing. It may come as a sudden flash of realization, or as a slow awakening. It may strike you as extremely obvious, with an ‘Of course! How did I not see this before?’ quality.

In his fascinating TED talk, Do We See Reality As It Is? cognitive neuroscientist Donald Hoffman uses your computer's desktop as a metaphor for perception. He explains that we don't see reality ‘as it is’. Rather, what we experience is an internally generated model, informed in part by our sensory data. We can think of time and space as our desktop, and the various ‘objects’ in our world (e.g. bananas, buildings, bodies) as symbols or icons on that desktop. Just as there are implications to interacting with an icon on your computer or smartphone, there are implications to interacting with the ‘icons’ in your world (e.g. people, pythons, poppadoms). 100% of your computer's desktop and the icons are generated from within the deeper properties of the device. Similarly, 100% of the desktop and icons of your perception (i.e. space, time and the physical and non-physical forms/ objects you perceive) are generated from within the deeper properties of life. These deeper properties are by definition formless, i.e. they are what generates the forms of your perception (the desktop and icons). At the end of his talk, Hoffman says… When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain, or neurons, I am interacting with reality, but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons. And that reality, whatever it is, is the real source of cause and effect in the world– not brains, not neurons. Brains and neurons have no causal powers. They cause none of our perceptual experiences, and none of our behavior.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The metaphors of MIND, THOUGHT and CONSCIOUSNESS are a way of referring to the deeper reality Hoffman is pointing to… the real source of cause and effect in the world and in your life. The principles of MIND, THOUGHT and CONSCIOUSNESS generate your perceptual reality and the sense of a ‘you’ that is experiencing it.

When people are looking for additive approaches, they're asking the question, ‘What do I need to add to my life/ myself/ my skills/ my personality to make me more X and less Y?’ The structure of the additive approach is always the same: This seductive and compelling promise is like crack cocaine to our insecurities. It's the driver behind the hundreds of millions of dollars made from ‘success’, ‘get rich quick’ and ‘how to x, y, z fast’ materials each year. This promise is the reason behind the colossal appetite for self-help books. It's why those magazines can put seven new tips on each month's cover. When we're feeling insecure, we're compelled by the notion of an additive approach. But there's a problem… Additive approaches rarely work In practice additive approaches rarely deliver the hoped-for results, and can even cause actual harm. For instance, in the USA, it's estimated that iatrogenic illness (illness caused accidentally by medical interventions) is the third biggest killer after heart disease and cancer. The 2012 arrest of 200 UK gang leaders under the banner of the government's ‘all-out war on gangs and gang culture’ backfired and created a dangerous power vacuum, with even more ruthless youngsters jockeying for position. When you read the seven top tips (or whatever), they instantly strike you as obvious (‘ Why didn't I think of that? I really should do that’) and are often forgotten the next instant. Why? Additive advice without embodied understanding has little or no effect. For example, doctors and nurses in the 1800s had to be forced to wash their hands, because they didn't have an understanding of germ theory. Once you understand the reality of germs, washing your hands is just common sense. Until you understand the reality of germs, it's just one more chore on an already long list. Subtraction is the secret of leadership The secret to leading yourself and others is subtraction. As I mentioned in Chapter 3, the CLARITY ® model is ruthlessly subtractive.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Clarity is your natural state of mind when there's no contaminated thinking getting in the way. When you've got nothing on your mind, your innate leadership qualities emerge effortlessly. When people first see this, they typically look for another additive approach, and ask ‘OK, how do I stop thinking so much? How do I get rid of my contaminated thinking?’ Surprisingly, the answer to this question isn't addition, but subtraction. A more leveraged question turns out to be ‘What's been giving rise to the contaminated thinking in the first place?’ After all, if we can identify the ‘cause’ of that thinking, we can address that and cut it off at the source! So what's the cause? Misunderstanding contaminates To answer that question, let's use physical health as an analogy. The human body has an incredible capacity for healing wounds, as long as the wound is free from contamination by germs and bacteria. In the 1830s, surgeons innocently infected their patients by operating on them with dirty scalpels in filthy operating theatres (nineteenth-century operating theatres were typically so dirty that the smell was almost unbearable). Surgeons had a misunderstanding about the cause of infection, and that misunderstanding gave rise to countless unintentional contaminations. Similarly, our misunderstanding of the cause of our experience (‘ the outside-in misunderstanding’) gives rise to the ‘contaminant’ of misinformed thinking. Understanding is subtractive Subtracting a misunderstanding, and getting more closely aligned with reality, has a profound effect. Ignaz Semmelweis' insights about the nature of germs and bacteria have resulted in a 30-year increase in the average lifespan of every person on the planet. Seeing through this misunderstanding about how life already works has had a bigger effect on physical wellbeing than all medical interventions combined. The harmful effects of the outside-in misunderstanding are infinitely more devastating than the combined benefits of every tip, technique, methodology, intervention or psychiatric medication ever developed. Seeing through the outside-in misunderstanding can provide enormous psychological benefit. And as your psychology is behind all your decisions, performances and results, the impact on your life as a whole can be truly profound. Getting a deeper understanding of the principles behind clarity unlocks your innate leadership qualities… The source of confidence, certainty and results.

Leadership is something you catch In my first book, CLARITY, I explained the difference between symptoms and causes as follows: DISTINCTION: Symptoms vs causes Acting like you have the symptoms of a cold is difficult and unconvincing. But when you have a cold, the bug causes the symptoms to emerge effortlessly and authentically. Most leadership books and programmes make a valiant effort to help people master the symptoms of leadership; behaviours, skills and attitudes, modelled from successful leaders (some of them extremely successful). Unfortunately, acting like you have the symptoms of leadership is difficult and unconvincing, because the symptoms aren't what's doing the ‘heavy lifting’. But when you have the ‘leadership bug’, it causes the symptoms to emerge effortlessly and authentically. The real power source is the cause that gives rise to the symptoms.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
So what's the cause that gives rise to the symptoms of leadership? The formless principles of MIND, CONSCIOUSNESS and THOUGHT. These principles create 100% of your moment-to-moment experience. When contaminated thinking is subtracted, they show up as your entrepreneurial superpowers; the eight deep drivers we mentioned in Chapter 1. These innate qualities are the source of emotional intelligence and authentic leadership…
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Direction: A sense of direction, purpose and motivation, free from urgency and undue pressure. Setting out to create a result requires a sense of direction, especially if you want to involve other people in that result.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Resilience: A strong sense of inner resilience, security and trust in yourself in life. Resilience is essential for dealing with the ups and downs of life, allowing you to navigate change and thrive through uncertainty. It's the deep driver behind why some people and organizations bounce back in the face of setbacks, while others struggle to recover.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Creativity: A reliable source of creativity, insight and inspired ideas. Creativity is the driver behind all problem-solving and an essential power source when it comes to creating results.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Authenticity: The freedom to be yourself, speak your truth and do what you know to be right. As well as being fundamental to discerning your authentic desires, ‘knowing yourself’ and walking your talk is also one of the keys to drawing other people to your cause if you want to involve others in the results you're creating.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Intuition: Alignment with your intuition and inner wisdom, your internal guidance system. Whether you call it intuition, wisdom or ‘gut feel’, extraordinary results-creators from Thomas Edison and Richard Branson to Oprah Winfrey and Steve Jobs have acknowledged it as one of the key drivers in creating results.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Presence: Present, aware and available to the moment, connected with your mind, your body and the world around you. Presence is a rare quality, but when someone has it, other people sit up and take notice. As well as being a key to influence, presence brings with it playful curiosity, charisma and enhanced awareness, making it particularly useful when it comes to creating results.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Connection: Warm, genuine connections with other people, leading to stronger relationships with clients, colleagues, friends, family members and lovers. Strong relationships are important, particularly when your results involve other people.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Clarity: A clear mind, free from contaminated thinking, fully present and in the moment, with the levels of performance, satisfaction and enjoyment that brings. We live in a world of increasing volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Clarity is the ability to discern the factors that make a difference and act on them productively, without being distracted by the ‘noise’ in the system.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
A goal is a thought; nothing more.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Any feeling you get when you think about a goal is telling you about your THOUGHT-generated perceptual reality in that moment, not about the result you're imagining. While a goal can be a useful tool (e.g. for helping you set a direction, organize your efforts or coordinate the efforts of a group of people), it has no power in and of itself.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
You have an innate capacity for achieving goals You set and achieve goals every day. Tasks as mundane as brushing your teeth, going for a walk or making a hot drink involve complex nested structures of goals, actions and evidence criteria.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
But if you look at it more closely, the action ‘Make and drink tea’ is itself composed of a number of goals, each with their own evidence and action (e.g. boil water, put teabag in cup, pour water on teabag, allow tea to brew, add milk, drink tea). If we looked even more closely, each of these would be composed of yet more goals with their own evidence and action.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The capacity that allows you to make a cup of tea without thinking about it is the same capacity that is going to support you in creating the results that matter to you: embodied understanding. When we have embodied understanding of a domain, we engage the complex network of relationships that allows us to get results in that context. You're said to have embodied understanding of a domain when you understand it at such a deep level, you don't even have to think about it. For instance, your embodied understanding of gravity helps you to walk, run, jump and negotiate crowded streets effortlessly. Your ability to create results in a given domain is a function of your embodied understanding of the reality of that domain. A person who has a deep embodied understanding of tennis is far more likely to win a match than someone who's never held a racquet. A person who has a deep embodied understanding of driving is likely to be a better driver than someone who's never been behind the wheel. Trailblazing artists like Dali, Picasso and Van Gogh produced work that was shocking and often outrageous in its time, but it was grounded in technical mastery and a deep understanding of their art form. So what does this have to do with the results you want to create? Here's what: Your ability to create results that are a perfect fit for you and your life is a function of your embodied understanding of how your mind works. Just as an athlete's embodied understanding of gravity will determine the quality of their athletic results, and a doctor's embodied understanding of anatomy will have an influence on the quality of their interventions… Your understanding of how your mind and perception work have an across-the-board influence on your ability to create the results that matter to you.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Toxic goals are goals grounded in the outside-in misunderstanding. They typically have an ‘I’ll be happy when…' or ‘I can't be happy until…’ structure, for instance…
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
These are all based around the false belief that our feelings are giving us information about our (future) circumstances. ‘Hedonic forecasting’ is the name given to our ability to predict how we're going to feel in future circumstances. It turns out that people are very poor judges of their future emotional state. Why? Because we get tricked by the outside-in misunderstanding. We innocently attribute our feelings to something other than THOUGHT in the moment. The second we do that, we're at risk of setting a toxic goal.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Authentic desires often arrive as insights and realizations, though they may have been travelling with you for a while as a kind of ‘knowing’ at the back of your mind. Here are some of the questions I sometimes ask my clients to start pointing them in the direction of their authentic desires… What do you want? What would you like to have happen? What would you love to create or bring into being? How will you know you've got that result? What will you see, hear and feel that will let you know you've got it? If you could wave a magic wand and have everything the way you want it to be, what would that look like? What would you want if you knew you couldn't fail? What would you want if you knew it was OK to fail? What would you want if you were guaranteed to get it? What would you do if you had £ 100 million in the bank? What would you do if all work paid the same, and you could get whatever work you like? What would you want if you didn't have to do anything? What would you want if you knew you were going to be happy, secure, successful and loved, whether you got it or not? What would you want if you didn't have to be unhappy about not getting it? If there were a miracle tonight, and when you woke up tomorrow everything was the way you want it to be, how would you know a miracle had happened? What would you see, hear, feel and know that would let you know a miracle had taken place? The purpose of these questions isn't for you to come up with specific goals as answers to them; the purpose is to guide you into a reflective space where you're more likely to have insights and realizations about what's important and meaningful to you and for you.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
So should I set goals or not? You already set and achieve goals. A more relevant question might be ‘When is it useful for me to set goals?’ The answer: when it makes sense. If it makes sense to set a specific target, set one. If it doesn't, don't.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
As stated earlier, goals can be useful for helping you set a direction, organize your own efforts or coordinate the efforts of a group of people. If you're creating a complex result that involves the work of many people, or things happening in a particular sequence, goals can be an incredibly useful part of the planning process (if you're building a house, you probably don't want the decorators arriving to start painting before the walls are up). But goals have no power in and of themselves. Set goals when it makes sense to do so. And if possible, set them from a clear state of mind.

When the ride was over, she said, ‘I was really frightened in the queue, but the ride was amazing! I really enjoyed it’. Her statement stopped me in my tracks, and I asked her what she made of that. She said, ‘I guess I was feeling my thinking in the queue, but I thought I was feeling the roller-coaster’.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
We're always living in the feeling of the principle of THOUGHT, taking form in the moment. But it often seems as though we're feeling something other than THOUGHT. Why? Because THOUGHT is a trickster. It will point the finger at anything but itself. When she was in the queue, it seemed as though Tallulah's feelings were coming from her future roller-coaster ride. In fact, she was experiencing a THOUGHT-generated illusion in the present. I told her, ‘As you go through life, you will see countless examples of people who believe they’re feeling the roller-coaster of their future, when really they're standing in the queue, feeling THOUGHT in the moment'.

You don't need to feel motivated to take action.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
In fact, it turns out that the most relevant time to take action can often be when you're not feeling motivated, enthusiastic or inspired.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
I was having a conversation with a client who had a project she wanted to move forward with. She told me that sometimes she felt really inspired and motivated about the project, but that other days she felt uninspired and listless. The changes in her feeling about the project were confusing to her, and she was hesitant to take action and move forward. ‘Would you want to make your project dependent on the weather?’ I asked her. She replied that she wouldn't want that. ‘Then why would you make your project dependent on how you feel on a given day?’ She looked perplexed, and said she thought that if it was the right thing to do, she would always feel inspired about it. I said, ‘Your feelings don't know about your project; your feelings only know about THOUGHT in the moment. Your moods are like the weather; they don't mean anything’. I explained that while purpose and inspiration can give you a glimpse of a possible future, we're always going to be subject to the ebb and flow of THOUGHT in the moment. And like the weather, your moods are not a reliable foundation to base your future on.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The inspiration myth goes something like this: ‘I’ll start taking action once I'm feeling inspired. Then I'll have a crystal clear vision of what I want to create, and I'll know exactly how I'm going to do it. My feeling of inspiration will give me the motivation I need to put in the effort'. While acts of creation sometimes result from this kind of inspiration, it's the exception rather than the rule. A much more common and reliable pattern of creation is the perspiration reality: ‘I’m not feeling inspired, but I'll start taking action anyway. At some point, inspiration strikes, or it doesn't. Either way, I'll keep taking action because what I'm working on matters to me'.

The experience of connection is natural when there's nothing else in the way. But the fact of connection is constant, even when you're not aware of it.

We each live in a separate, THOUGHT-generated perceptual reality. We're living in a THOUGHT-generated experience, but it often seems as though our feelings are letting us know about something other than THOUGHT. In fact, it often seems as though our feelings are telling us about another person. But that's not possible, at the level of principle. Your feelings are letting you know about what's happening in your perception.

94% of the leaders identified the states that drove the highest levels of performance as ‘calm’, ‘happy’ and ‘energized’ (CHE). At the other end of the spectrum, leaders admitted to spending a certain amount of time in low-performance states; ‘frustrated’, ‘anxious’, ‘tired’ and ‘stressed’ (FATS). The article suggested that CHE states not only drove high performance; these states also seemed to be ‘transmitted’ to other people. Conversely, the FATS states often delivered short-term results, but were damaging in the long term, particularly in the domain of relationships.

if you tell someone you're frustrated, stressed or worried, the first thing they typically do is ask you, ‘Why? What about?’ These questions innocently affirm the outside-in misunderstanding by inviting you to attribute your feelings to something other than THOUGHT in the moment.

Think of one of your favourite films or TV shows. There are two things you need to enjoy the show: You have to be able to be ‘swept away’ by the film
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
You have to be able to ‘wake up’ from the film's illusionary reality While it's wonderful to be swept away by a film, we also have to be able to wake up to the fact that it's an illusion (otherwise you'd phone the fire department if flames appeared on the screen).
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Enjoying a movie requires an oscillation between these two positions; being swept away by the film's illusionary reality, occasionally punctuated by waking up to the fact that it's just a movie. This is exactly the same kind of oscillation you need to enjoy your life, to wake up from FATS and experience CHE states of mind, more and more of the time.

You have to be able to be ‘swept away’ by the principle of THOUGHT
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
When we're moved by the sight of a beautiful sunrise, filled up with love for someone we care about or inspired by a leader's visionary words, we've been swept away by the principle of THOUGHT. Those beautiful feelings are coming from THOUGHT taking form in the moment within you, but it often seems like they're coming from the sunrise, the leader or the loved one. When we're anxious about a future appointment, worried about someone we care about or angry about someone's past behaviours, we've been swept away by the principle of THOUGHT. Those uncomfortable feelings are coming from THOUGHT taking form in the moment, but it seems like they're coming from somewhere other than THOUGHT; from the appointment, the person we're concerned about or the wrongdoer's behaviours. This is the illusionary power of THOUGHT. You have to be able to ‘wake up’ from THOUGHT's illusory reality We all get swept away by THOUGHT, but we all have the power to wake up from THOUGHT's illusory reality; to fall out of the La-La Land of our contaminated thinking, and fall present to the moment. We've all had the experience of being very worried about something before going to sleep, then waking up the next morning wondering how we'd managed to get so bothered about it. Little children intuitively grasp the illusory nature of THOUGHT, able to flit from sobbing with misery to giggling with joy in the blink of an eye. In any moment, we can realize that we're feeling THOUGHT taking form, and not what we're thinking about. The instant this happens, we fall out of the La-la Land of our misunderstanding, and ‘fall awake’ to the present. A rich, enjoyable experience of life relies on an oscillation between the two positions mentioned above; getting swept away by the principle of THOUGHT in the moment, then waking up to the illusory nature of THOUGHT. And as you continue to explore the principles behind clarity, your understanding of the deceptive and illusory nature of THOUGHT will allow you to enjoy this oscillation more and more. And it turns out that's the only thing you need to live a life you love and experience high-performance states of mind, more of the time. The one thing you need to enjoy a movie is an understanding of the nature of film. The one thing you need to enjoy your life is an understanding of the nature of THOUGHT.

You can think of the principle of THOUGHT as being like the ‘pixels’ of our perception; the creative energy that ‘renders’ the desktop (space and time), as well as the objects we perceive on that desktop (e.g. people, places, things, our own bodies, our self-images, the countless thoughts that pass through our minds each day). The principle of CONSCIOUSNESS is like the computer's screen, giving you an experience of the THOUGHT-generated reality you're creating in the moment. All of this is powered by the principle of MIND, the intelligent energy behind life. The formless principles behind clarity are at your very core; the essence of your being…

We all have areas in our lives where things flow effortlessly, and other areas where we struggle. There's a way in which all my clients have the same two challenges when I first meet them. You're about to realize the only two challenges that ever stop people making progress, and the unexpected key this realization holds for creating results.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Challenge one: Preoccupation
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
They've given it a lot of thought, and that's usually made matters worse.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Here are some examples of the kinds of things people have been thinking far too much about: I want to get slim, fit and healthy, but I keep falling back into bad habits. I'm desperate to improve my money situation, but nothing seems to change. I'm trying to find the right relationship (or fix my current one). I'm trying to find my purpose in life, my true calling. I need to get more clients. I want to raise morale in my company, and get people more engaged. I've been thinking about starting my own business. I'm trying to change my limiting beliefs. I'm trying to figure out what our competitors are planning to do that could knock us out of the game. I want to play a bigger game but I don't know what it is. I want to spend less time at the office and more time with my family. We need to disrupt our industry before someone else does. I want to change our company culture but nothing seems to work.

The unexpected solution
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
We've been conditioned to seek additive approaches, so when I explain the two challenges, the next question is usually, ‘So how do I fix that?’. But there's a more useful question to ask first: ‘Why do people get stuck in these two challenges in the first place?’ The answer to this is simple: contaminated thinking arising from the outside-in misunderstanding.

The solution is a deeper embodied understanding of the principles behind clarity; an intuitive feel for the inside-out nature of how your mind and perception already works.

Implication-based Learning
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
You've already been doing IBL your whole life, but you may not have had a distinction for it until now. IBL is the learning that takes place automatically when you're exposed to sensory data (like a human version of the machine-learning algorithms that are increasingly shaping our digital environment). Obvious examples include how you learned to walk and talk, even though no-one ‘taught’ you how to do them.

Like gravity, the principles behind clarity are a pre-existing fact of life. You're born into them. But unlike gravity, the principles are non-obvious; they're invisible (like germs, only more so– you won't see the principles of MIND, CONSCIOUSNESS and THOUGHT using a microscope, because they're what's creating your experience of what you see when you use a microscope). The purpose of this book (and of all my work) is to make these principles ‘visible’ to you so that an automatic IBL curve is initiated, and you start benefiting from a deep embodied understanding of these principles. That way, application becomes automatic. As your embodied understanding of the principles behind clarity deepens, you get to benefit from that understanding throughout your day without even thinking about it. This is the source of the kind of clarity that leads to meaningful results.
</div>

Let's take public speaking as an example. An enormous percentage of the population are afraid of public speaking. If you ask them why, they'll give you a long list of reasons (‘ What if I don't remember what to say? I’m nervous in case I look stupid. I'm worried about what people are thinking about me'). When they see someone for whom public speaking is effortless, the nervous speaker assumes that the confident speaker is finding answers to all those questions and concerns, but that's not the case. Ask a confident speaker what they're thinking about when they're in front of an audience, and they'll usually say ‘Nothing’. They're typically in an open, responsive state of mind with their attention on the audience and how their message is landing. Remember: when true causes are not understood, spurious causes and solutions proliferate.

Your mind is a self-correcting system We all lose our bearings from time to time, whether it's dealing with a difficult relationship, handling an unexpected situation or supporting a challenging client. But fortunately, your mind is a self-correcting system. We each have a kind of ‘inner sat-nav’ that allows us to keep our bearings when the going gets rough, and return to clarity quickly when we do temporarily lose our way. Imagine a river that's being polluted by sewage from the outflow pipe of a factory. Upstream from the factory, the river still flows clear and pure. But downstream, the river is contaminated with toxic waste and the wildlife is suffering. Downstream, you could do your very best to clean the riverbanks and heal the wildlife, but your efforts would have no lasting effect while the factory is still contaminating the water with its noxious sewage. The solution is clear: shut down the factory! As it's toxic output starts reducing, the river becomes less and less contaminated, and something wonderful starts to happen; the natural ecosystem starts to cleanse and heal itself. Figure 14.1: The River of Consciousness And how is it able to cleanse and heal itself? Because at the river's source is a flow of fresh, clean, pure water. Whenever the outflow of contamination is stopped, even for a moment, the source of fresh clean water starts refreshing the ecosystem and clarity emerges. Why? Because clarity is the water's natural state. Clarity is your mind's natural state. I don't usually ‘unpack’ analogies, but this one is worth looking at directly… The outside-in misunderstanding is the ‘factory’ that contaminates the river. Contaminated thinking is the ‘sewage’ the factory produces. The river's source is MIND, the intelligent energy behind life. The river is the principle of THOUGHT, creating our perceptual experience and connecting us to that source. Attempts to clean the river are the additive, outside-in methods we use to try and change our felt experience, after it's been contaminated (the psychological equivalent of trying to un-bake a cake). Shutting down the factory represents the subtractive effect of a deeper embodied understanding of the principles behind clarity.

How to clear your mind Your mind is a self-correcting system. The only thing that ever slows the process of self-correction is the mistaken belief that we're feeling something other than THOUGHT in the moment. So what do you need to do to clear your mind? Keep your fingers out of the machinery and continue deepening your understanding of the principles behind clarity.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
you'll find your mind's self-correcting system restoring you to clarity more and more quickly and easily.

If you want a universal example of this, look at how quickly and effortlessly small children get caught up in contaminated thinking (tantrums, fears, shyness) then self-correct to clarity, curiosity and contentment. They are benefiting from exactly the same self-correcting system as you and me; they just haven't had the time to build a rigid ‘game plan’ for how life works (based in large part on the outside-in misunderstanding).
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
many of the biggest problems in our lives, our organizations and our world are the result of our misguided attempts to find peace, security and clarity using outside-in methods;
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
The entrepreneur who smokes a cigarette or sucks on a vape to ‘relax’ and ends up hooked. The teenager who uses social media to ‘connect’ and becomes obsessed with others' validation. The manager who uses alcohol to medicate ‘work-related stress’ and starts making mistakes on the job. The sportsperson who cheats because they believe their wellbeing is dependent on winning. The CEO who's so focused on ‘hitting the number’ that they lose their top talent. The parent who ‘comfort eats’ to quash feelings of anxiety and gains excess weight. The dictator who wages war on his own people to safeguard his sense of security and success.

The patterns of misunderstanding are a reflection of two ‘flavours’ of the outside-in misunderstanding. Flavour 1: It often seems like a person's feelings of stress, boredom or emotional discomfort are coming from somewhere other than THOUGHT in the moment (e.g. from their workload, their boss, next week's meeting, last week's argument, their bank balance, their childhood, what they're like as a person). Flavour 2: It often seems like a person's feelings of relief, peace and excitement are coming from somewhere other than THOUGHT in the moment (e.g. from a drink, a drug, a cigarette, gambling, sex, food, habitual behaviours). In both instances, it seems like our feelings are coming from somewhere other than THOUGHT, but that's not how it works. We're always living in the feeling of THOUGHT in the moment, even when it appears as if our feelings are coming from somewhere else.
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
As soon as we assign our unpleasant feelings to a cause other than THOUGHT in the moment, we innocently reinforce the false belief that we are separate from and at the mercy of a world ‘out there’ in space and time, with power over how we feel. It then seems sensible that we look ‘out there’ for a solution. We all get tricked by the outside-in misunderstanding; we're innocently walking around in a THOUGHT-generated perceptual reality, and relating to it as an actual reality. But as you continue waking up from this misunderstanding, you're going to find yourself falling out of contaminated thinking more and more quickly and easily. And when you fall out of a contaminated Narnia, where you land is reality. And why is that important?
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Because you're built for reality and optimized for results. You've evolved to survive, transform and thrive. When you land in reality, you discover you have what you need to deliver the goods (in fact, it often looks less like ‘wisdom’ and more like ‘common sense’). And this isn't just true for you. It's true for everyone on the planet. Your colleagues, clients and customers. The people you lead, manage or coach. Your family, friends and lovers. Everyone.
</div>

<div class="noteText">
Reality check ‘Hang on a second– if the system is self-correcting, why have I been stressed out for years? My system must be on the blink, because it hasn't been correcting’. Don't underestimate the power of the outside-in misunderstanding to keep people in suffering for days, months and even years. While there are often moments of peace, clarity or levity in the midst of ‘depressive periods’ or the ‘constant stress’ reported by many employees, they can be short-lived. Why? Because the outside-in misunderstanding is compelling and being reinforced by marketing, media, friends, family and our own perceptual system.

When it comes to deciding what's right for you and your life, nobody has more access to wisdom than you. Not your parents, not your friends, not your priest, not your partner.

<div class="noteText">
there's a flavour of ‘I don't know’ that's rich and juicy, with a sense of wonder and curiosity. At the other end of the spectrum is a flavour that comes with stress and pressure; like when a teacher asks you a question in front of the class that you're supposed to know the answer to, but don't.

How to make good decisions
</div>
<br>
<div class="noteText">
Some decisions seems trivial (e.g. choosing your breakfast, a pair of socks or what movie to watch). Some seem more significant (e.g. selecting a holiday, buying a car or accepting a promotion). Some can seem enormous (e.g. moving in together, changing careers or starting a new venture) and some have consequences that are truly vast (e.g. cutting jobs, exiting the European Union or going to war). But here's the thing: while different decisions bring different consequences and levels of complexity, there's nothing in reality that makes one decision more difficult than another… The outside-in misunderstanding is the main source of difficulty in decision-making… But as you fall out of the complexity of contaminated thinking… You fall into the simplicity of wisdom and common sense.

Reality check ‘Wait a minute…’ I hear you say. ‘What about when someone gives me the creeps, or I suddenly get the sense that I shouldn't go down a particular street. Are you really saying that's just THOUGHT?’ Yes and no. We have our senses for a reason; they give us essential information about reality that we calibrate to so we can survive and thrive. If you see a fire engine speeding towards you, step out of its way. 100% of your experience of the fire engine is THOUGHT-generated, but there are massive physical-world implications if you get hit by one. And consider this: who's more likely to accidentally step in front of a speeding fire engine: someone who's present and aware, with a clear head and in touch with reality? Or someone who's preoccupied with contaminated thinking? When you're present and aware, THOUGHT is free to do what it does best: guide you through reality in this game we call life.

‘When do you get your best ideas?’ I've asked thousands of people this question, ranging from parents to therapists, from athletes to leadership teams. The answers are always the same…– In the shower– In the bath– Dropping off to sleep– Waking up in the morning– Travelling to and from work– Walking in the woods– Working out at the gym– Running or riding– Relaxing with friends– Sitting by the ocean– On holiday– When the plane leaves the runway– Connecting with other people– When I stop thinking about a problem– When I'm doing something else– etc We're built for exponential insight!

I love having zero-pressure sales conversations, so I'll sometimes ask a prospective client to help me out, saying, ‘I want us to have a zero-pressure conversation, so I need to ask you a favour: if you feel even an ounce of sales pressure while we’re talking, will you let me know?'
